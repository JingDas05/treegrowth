 **treegrowth**  
  this is a basic practice project，contains _spring boot_,_spring security_, _spring data_, _elasticserach_, _mongodb_, _redis_ and so on,  
  i believe that if want to master a skill， the best method is to use it  
  it is easy to start the project  
  as it is based on spring boot  
  first, go into the treegrowth-configuration-server and find the main class,run it,then the spring config server will start  
  on the port 0001  
  secondly go into treegrowth-web find the main class and run it,then the whole project will start on port 1111 and read config from  port 1111  
  lastly,run kafka on 9092,run zookeeper on 2181, run mongodb on 27017, run postgresql on 5432, run resdis on 6379,then you can use postman or  
  other tools to get put delete the user api, and login, it also support third part login such as github  
  be pleasure to get suggest from you , this project will like the tree to grow constantly!
